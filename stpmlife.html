    <center><h4>The title of the geography assignment at that time was to study the tree species in the forest. Therefore, all schools across the state of Perlis that offered geography were required to conduct a field study to complete the assignment. 
                As a result, all the teachers agreed to conduct the study at Tasik Melati to examine the unique plant species.
                My friends and I chose an area near the swamp because most of the plants there thrived well. 
                We studied all types of trees in that area, from large trees to small ones.</br></h4></center>

       <center><h4>Form 6 students who were members of PISPA at that time were required to attend the Basic Course of the Civil Defense Force (APM). The course was held at the Perlis Civil Defense Force for 3 days and 2 nights.
                   Various activities were conducted, such as foot drills, CPR, rescue activities, firefighting techniques, and more.
                   The most challenging activity for me was entering a large drain while carrying a victim. 
                   This activity was a simulation for assisting injured flood victims.</h4></center>

    <center><h4>At that time, several Form 6 students were selected by the teacher to be facilitators for the leadership camp for Form 4 and 5 students, including me. We stayed overnight with those students for 3 days and 2 nights. 
                We led them in several activities given by the teacher. I led an activity where they had to find cones of the same color while blindfolded. 
                The rest of the students, who were not blindfolded, would give directions to their blindfolded friends.<h4></center>

               I participated in three sports events, netball, traditional games, and bowling. In these three sports, my two friends and I won third place in the traditional game competition, specifically "batu seremban," at the state level. 
               At that time, my school also hosted the futsal event, and the closing ceremony was organized by all of us.</center></h4>
