      The first picture is from Co-curriculum Day, which required all the uniformed bodies to cook. We, the Scouts, cooked lasagna and won first place that day. 
      Additionally, the second picture shows the uniformed bodies camp that was held. We stayed overnight for a few days in the dormitory. 
      Finally, I led the royal parade on the Excellence Awards Day.</h4></center>

                 During this period, a dinner was organized with all the dormitory residents. 
                 The last picture taken was a farewell gesture with the dormitory supervisor.<h4></center>
